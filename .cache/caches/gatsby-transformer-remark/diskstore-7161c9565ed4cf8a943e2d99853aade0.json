Seeing that it was near the end of a decade, I wanted to document the music that I found impactful and defined the past 10 years. Using the Jonathan Edwards printing press and Yale Printing & Publishing Services, I produced 10 disc-shaped leaflets bound in a jewel case, each telling the story of one album.\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n        <b>Problem</b> But, afterall, it was printed in an edition of five, with one sent to the Special Collections at Yale.
