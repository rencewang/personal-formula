Now, it reminds me of Camp Yale So. Damn. Much.

It makes me think of lying in the Silliman courtyard, walking down Wall Street for another info session, going to Starbucks to get a venti water and keeping the cup for the whole month because it had a straw, sitting in the common room of people whose world views you weren't sure aligned with yours and yet, at that moment, you were just happy to be there.
