I've always found it interesting, the way we are conditioned to associate certain memories with music and how they evoke the same emotional and conscious response every time, but never have I found it so infuriating.

The standout from the album, and what absolutely should have been the lead single, was Cruel Summer, a song that combines everything I loved from the New Romantics - Getaway Car trajectory.  Now, it reminds me of Camp Yale So. Damn. Much. When I listen to it I can hear my own yearning in those early college days, the hope for some exquisite chance encounter to befall upon me, the days in New Haven when it was warm enough for shorts — I can feel the breeze blowing by my legs. It makes me think of lying in the Silliman courtyard, walking down Wall Street for another info session, going to Starbucks to get a venti water and keeping the cup for the whole month because it had a straw, sitting in the common room of people whose world views you weren't sure aligned with yours and yet, at that moment, you were just happy to be there. Cruel Summer is strangeness and inclusion, excitement and fear, hope and the aftermath when bubbles of hope are popped one by one.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":8,"offset":916},"end":{"line":5,"column":1398,"offset":2306}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":909},"end":{"line":5,"column":1398,"offset":2306}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"California","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":4,"offset":2313},"end":{"line":7,"column":14,"offset":2323}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":2310},"end":{"line":7,"column":14,"offset":2323}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Though written about wanting someone back, California is when sadness seeps through the semi-permeable membrane you've built to guard yourself. \"You're scared to win, scared to lose.

I see the Old Navy in Midtown, the Ding Tea, and the Shake Shack in Grand Central. I think of that one night in New York, when I was planning on staying at NYU until I learned about their stupid policy regarding overnight guests, at which point I decided I would take a 1-hour subway ride uptown at 1 A.M. and completely embarrass myself by entering my friend's apartment complex, looking assured about where I'm headed because I did not want to interact with the lobby staff, and walking into a random elevator that, as it turns out, did not go to his floor. There was also no signal in the building, so I had to wander around the third floor for 30 minutes before I found another elevator.
