They depress me so much.”</em></h3>\n<p>I first learned about Oscar Wilde through his fairy tales.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> At a time when I was devouring kid’s books and graphic novels, his stories, with their tragic undertones, stood out to me among the likes of Cinderella and Thumbelina and especially Snow White, whom I absolutely despised because I thought she was useless and had no skills besides talking to animals. On the other hand, the Happy Prince with his jewels ripped away, blind and alone in the winter cold, the Nightingale with her chest pierced, dying of blood loss — their suffering resonated with me and inspired me. </p>\n<p>As you can see, my inclination for tragedy emerged at a young age. In fact, I’ve always dreaded comedies: they’re shallow and boring and provide no insights nor wisdom. I like books that make me feel wistful and ashamed and stupid and sad, but definitely not happy, because happy endings do end up depressing me so much. To this day, I still don’t get the point of <em>Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, a play that generates no profound reflections and (not that I’m proud of this in any sense) remains the sole production that brought me to sleep in a packed auditorium. I enjoy <em>Macbeth</em> much better, for it not only warns against power and ambition, but also teaches important life lessons from the legendary Lady Macbeth herself, such as “Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.” Chris McCandless is a wandering legend because he dies on his travels, <em>Madame Bovary</em> is a cautionary classic because Emma fails her romantic endeavors at self-reinvention. A story without misery is a soulless one, I thought.</p>\n<p>All of this means there was no logical reason for me to read <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> because, let’s be honest, few plays are more comedic. Yet, as fate would have it, I had just finished <em>Long Day’s Journey into Night</em>, and although I appreciated O’Neill’s autobiographical masterpiece immensely, I found myself needing something to overturn the desolate cloud of hopelessness that would otherwise surely launch me into a depressive episode. That’s how I picked up this play. At the time, it did the job. I found it to be genuinely funny and incredibly witty, and it reminded me of the Dowager Countess of Grantham in <em>Downton Abbey</em> (whose roasts and comebacks I idolize), but that’s as much as I thought about it — upon finishing, I went straight back to my marathon of depressing literature with <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. </p>\n<h3><em>“I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.”</em></h3>\n<p>On a rare, serene, work-free night, I finally watched <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em>. During the film, I couldn’t help but notice the similarities between Matt Damon’s impersonation of the rich playboy and pretending to be Ernest, so I made the midnight decision to read <em>The Importance of Being Earnest again</em>. This time around, no longer the palate cleanser between two dismal plays, it brought me, in addition to subdued chuckles as I tried not to wake my roommate, considerations of my own hypocrisy.</p>\n<p>I hated the first couple of weeks of college. I hated being herded like cattle in our froco groups (please, we just graduated and know how school works). I hated never having the time to collect my thoughts since we were either at some random workshop or on the way to a random workshop. I hated the fact that all of this mandatory socialization has a name — “Camp Yale” — as if it’s so glorious. Now, after two semesters of refamiliarizing myself with the fast-paced cycle of lectures-homework-exam which reminds me, more than anything, of the terrors of high school, I miss it and think I was an idiot for hating weeks of having no work whatsoever.</p>\n<h3><em>“To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.”</em></h3>\n<p>What I have only recently noticed, as I started reminiscing the good old days, is how social I had been during Camp Yale. I was eager to meet new people through childish scavenger hunts and enthusiastic to introduce myself in awkward icebreakers, and it’s not until my introverted and passive self began to show, as the cordiality receded like an ebb tide, that I realized it might have been nothing more than a grand façade— the outgoingness grossly unrepresentative of me in my natural habitat. In retrospect, it was exhausting to seem naturally versed in social functions. Talking to people was mentally frustrating, going out was physical exhausting, and having people forget your name every time you see them was frustrating and exhausting. It was all an overwhelming burden on my less-than-expressive self.</p>\n<p>How I survived those weeks as a high-spirited creature remains a mystery to me, but I suspect it had something to do with the fact that I was constantly surrounded by such an illustrious and gregarious crowd (some of them believers of <em>once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own relations</em><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>), that I felt like I needed to change myself to conform, to blend in, to seem like I belonged and deserved to be here, as if socialness equated cleverness. (Although after rereading The Importance of Being Earnest, I will now say: “I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays.”)</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t exactly term it “imposter syndrome,” but I feel like one sometimes, when I pretend like I care, or that I’m nice, or that I’m actually interested in what the person sitting across from me in the dining hall is saying. One life lesson I’ve learned over the years is that once in a while, you have to “fake it till you make it.” Not exactly a positive idea, but one that has worked, one that has earned me labels of being nice and social and helpful. The side effect, however, is becoming addicted to pretense. You lose focus, because for as long as you haven’t made it, you would be faking it, because lies lead to lies lead to more lies. </p>\n<p>The problematic thing about an international public health emergency that forces the closure of schools, restaurants, and social events, aside from the fact that I've been rotting away at home and can't even find solace in the slim chance that I might be able to go to Glastonbury over the summer since both Glastonbury and London and my study abroad program are likely cancelled, is the fact that I can't even listen to music in peace anymore. I've always found it interesting, the way we are conditioned to associate certain memories with music and how they evoke the same emotional and conscious response every time, but never have I found it so infuriating. So many songs in my Spotify library have such distinct moments written across them that it becomes impossible to listen to practically anything without wondering, with the utmost confusion, where did my freshman year go?</p>\n<h2>Cruel Summer</h2>\n<p><em>Lover</em> dropped while I was digging holes to defecate in and hating my life in the Appalachian wilderness, so I did not get to hear the album first hand. But I did the moment I stepped foot on civilization and got my lovely T-Mobile 4G LTE network back (with the headphones that were not supposed to be on the trip but I sneaked them in anyway), and on the bus from New Hampshire to Connecticut I listened to it and fell asleep. The standout from the album, and what absolutely should have been the lead single, was Cruel Summer, a song that combines everything I loved from the New Romantics - Getaway Car trajectory.  Now, it reminds me of Camp Yale So. Damn. Much. When I listen to it I can hear my own yearning in those early college days, the hope for some exquisite chance encounter to befall upon me, the days in New Haven when it was warm enough for shorts — I can feel the breeze blowing by my legs. It makes me think of lying in the Silliman courtyard, walking down Wall Street for another info session, going to Starbucks to get a venti water and keeping the cup for the whole month because it had a straw, sitting in the common room of people whose world views you weren't sure aligned with yours and yet, at that moment, you were just happy to be there. Cruel Summer is strangeness and inclusion, excitement and fear, hope and the aftermath when bubbles of hope are popped one by one.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<h2>California</h2>\n<p>Though written about wanting someone back, California is when sadness seeps through the semi-permeable membrane you've built to guard yourself. \"You're scared to win, scared to lose. I've heard the war was over if you really choose\" reminds me of the light drizzles that occupied New Haven's winter, and walking down Hillhouse in midst of the rain without an umbrella. The moments when nostalgia rushes to my head and says: California, In-N-Out, Sprouts, Brown Cow, Sharetea, they melted with academic burdens that seem like nothing in retrospect, but were suffocating at the time, in Lana's slow murmuring.</p>\n<h2>Beautiful Ghosts</h2>\n<p>I had been anticipating this release for more than a month, ever since hearing the 10 second <em>Cats</em> promotion clip — a movie I was actually hoping to see but never did because I got scared after reading the reviews. Well, at least the song turned out to be great and made me cry that Friday at 1 A.M. In the coming weeks I blasted the song in the common room so many times that all my suite mates grew tired of it. Today it still gives me chills, especially the \"I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into\" moment, which makes me think of all the internship rejections I received, in addition to wondering about spending the summer in London, which is no longer happening so idk who I was kidding.</p>\n<h2>Light On</h2>\n<p>When I first discovered <em>Heard It In A Past Life</em> I thought I found a gem: Maggie Rogers's debut was sensational and genuine. Now when I listen to it I see New York. I see the time we ate hot pot and got Boba Guys on the TD sponsored trip, and how we had to scuffle our way through the Times Square crowd to catch the bus. I see the Old Navy in Midtown, the Ding Tea, and the Shake Shack in Grand Central. I think of that one night in New York, when I was planning on staying at NYU until I learned about their stupid policy regarding overnight guests, at which point I decided I would take a 1-hour subway ride uptown at 1 A.M. and completely embarrass myself by entering my friend's apartment complex, looking assured about where I'm headed because I did not want to interact with the lobby staff, and walking into a random elevator that, as it turns out, did not go to his floor. There was also no signal in the building, so I had to wander around the third floor for 30 minutes before I found another elevator. I woke up the next morning at 7, and sat down at a nearby Starbucks thinking: \"Wow, this must be what college is like.\"</p>\n<p>Another time, after briefly stopping by the NYU Weinstein lounge where Chinese international students were playing mafia until 3 A.M., I walked to the 8th Street Station to get to JFK for my 8 A.M. flight. There was not a single soul in the station, so instead of waiting on the empty, eerie platform for the N train which never came, I dragged my suitcases up the stairs into the rain. It was cold. I was alone. My bags were drenched. But I enjoyed having the streets to myself — it felt regal, and I liked how the lights were blurred by downpour, then reflected by puddles, then shattered by droplets hitting the surface. <strong>Light On reminds me of the rain that night.</strong></p>\n<h2>If the World Was Ending</h2>\n<p>I love the first line of the song \"I was distracted and in traffic, I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened\" because I don't feel earthquakes when I'm in cars, except for that one time when I did, after which I drove to Urban Outfitters and got boba. The song makes me think of staying at friends' suite until late, watching them dance to Super Bass, eating McDonald's and getting stomach cramps afterwards. Now, although my freshman year is in shambles, school is shut down, borders are closed, I still don't want to forget anything that happened because it was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting; and here's a customary Taylor Swift quote: \"We're all really sad that this is ending, but we're really happy because of what it was.\"</p>\n<p>With the death toll becoming more and more \"just a number,\" the hysterical shopping for toilet paper, the staying at home and not getting Chick-fil-A or tofu for months to come, I reckon it feels pretty much like the end of the world. But trust, though I might not be able to get out of my house-arrest to stay the night, that it will be fine — corona is not down for forever anyway.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>This is the first footnote.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This is the first footnote.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"}
