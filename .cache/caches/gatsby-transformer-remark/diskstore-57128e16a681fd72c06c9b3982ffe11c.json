It also allows parents to monitor kids’ progress and activity, message in family group chat, and control kids’ content.\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/projectimages/.jpg\" alt=\"GT header\"></p>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"research\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Research\n</span>\n    Through our research, we’ve concluded the following:\n</div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>Kids Love:</em></th>\n<th><em>We Decided:</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Learn through doing</strong></td>\n<td>Opportunity to watch educational videos and complete activities with Nickelodeon characters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Surprises and challenges</strong></td>\n<td>Daily quizzes about Nickelodeon characters and health tips about keeping the household safe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feedback and rewards</strong></td>\n<td>Earn “seeds” as in-app currency for purchasing plants for the garden; instant response to actions, such as quiz submission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ease of navigation</strong></td>\n<td>Simple navigation consisting of taps and scrolls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"design\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Design\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"csblock\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"> \n    <b>Garden:</b> I was responsible for creating graphical contents, as well as exploring the interactions for the garden page.

The world-building aspect of the design was appreciated by the judges, who advised the creation of an even more immersive experience. In the future, introducing varieties of plants and making the app revolve more around the virtual world are possibilities for exploration.\n        <li style=\"padding-top: 10px;\">Furthermore, had there been more time, user-testing with kids is another direction worth attempting. It would have allowed us to pinpoint the interest of the specific demographics. Researching what apps are used and loved by kids in the age group would offer insight into whether our design was too playful, and whether middle schoolers would consider it too childish.\n    </ul>\n</div>"}
