          "My mind as divided in three sections: one representing the nostalgic and traditional, one exhibiting the creative and interdisciplinary, and one illustrating the romantic and volatile. Through combining watercolor pieces with digital manipulation, I was able to experiment with different shades of complimentary colors and convey meaning through an audacious presentation."

          "The transcendence of a jellyfish as triggered by purple photons. The volumetric shapes are inspired by my experimentation with various fluid forms in Cinema 4D: the digital software’s ability to manipulate glossy textures and to capture bodies in motion sparked my interest in the specific concept. Through this piece, I wanted to show how objects interact with each other and how light and shadow function holistically in a setting."

Construction of the piece involved combination of various textures, such as the smooth marker and plastic, the rough strokes of colored pencils, and the unique, cloud-like foam background. Through presenting the process of fluid shapes morphing into distinct modular buildings, I hope to convey the road from elemental units to advanced civilization, and how the progress towards technology continues to shape our journey."

The bubbles represent the ephemerality of life, whereas the cage symbolizes the limiting effects of societal preconceptions. The piece seeks to convey the ideas of journey, fluid forms, and freedom that are present in my other works. To complete the piece, I used wood and steel to create the cage and blow-able balloons for the delicateness of the bubbles."

Take the journey upward with the waves and you’ll meet the mythical, ritualistic bronze tree, rumored to be built during the Shang dynasty to connect the mortal world with the heavens. Aside from the extensive use of symbols, I focused on creating depth with line weight and using line density to establish the hierarchy of elements."

Combining various historic elements, I attempted to build meaning with the negative space. Through organizing the elements, I created a sense of space and depth through the indication of direction, the use of shadows, and contrast between white, shaded, and colored regions."
