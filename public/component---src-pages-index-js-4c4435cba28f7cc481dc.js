Summer is coming, the best batch of loquat is ready for picking, the crisis-mode-marked-by-six-feet-apart-crosses line at Costco, well, probably hasn\'t actually changed but subconsciously it seems shorter.

So it should come as no surprise that The Next Best American Record happened to be the first song from Norman Fucking Rockwell! that I fell for — the nonsensical lyrics are so fun to decode, though they probably mean nothing, and…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Corona, College, and Us","permalink":"/blog/corona","updated":"March 20, 2020","category":"Personal","description":"There was not a single soul in the station, so instead of waiting on the empty, eerie platform for the N train which never came, I dragged my suitcases up the stairs into the rain. It was cold. I was alone. My bags were drenched. But I enjoyed having the streets to myself — it felt regal, and I liked how the lights were blurred by downpour, then reflected by puddles, then shattered by droplets hitting the surface. Light On reminds me of the rain that night."},"id":"391b8292-4fec-5f5c-bbff-25daa4c31df8","excerpt":"The problematic thing about an international public health emergency that forces the closure of schools, restaurants, and social events, aside from the fact that I\'ve been rotting away at home and can\'t even find solace in the slim chance that I might be able to go to Glastonbury over the summer since both Glastonbury and London and my study abroad program are likely cancelled, is the fact that I…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Suburbia","permalink":"/blog/suburbia","updated":"January 23, 2020","category":"Personal","description":"I guess you always start off wide-eyed about everything. But the novelty wears off as soon as you come to the realization that any stranger you lay your eyes on the street might have a totally unique story, a story that might remain a mystery to you forever. You realize the planet is filled to its brink with extraordinary people doing all sorts of things. That’s why you would, while traversing the vast and lonely world, reminisce more furiously about the suburbia."},"id":"ececb1d3-43ee-5847-abc8-9addd2b512df","excerpt":"When it comes to goodbyes, I’m experienced, or so I thought. Last summer, I said goodbye to skipping school for a Starbucks run under the 90-degree California sun. Before that, I said goodbye to lunch under woven canopies that never stopped the rain from wetting our food. Further back, I said goodbye to the comforts of motherland and native tongue. Moving across the country for college?

Understanding our own fragility makes us more accepting of others. Understanding our own defects makes us braver and more honest. I Forgot That You Existed, with playful and light presentation, contrasts greatly against the dark, gothic tracks from reputation. It\'s Nice To Have A Friend is the other side to This Is Why We Can\'t Have Nice Things.

Maybe we’re not quite ready for them today, but I know we’ll be ready someday. If we don’t get there, we’ll get somewhere. And I hope that the belief in someday, the dream of somewhere, will be our solace in midst of the ceaseless cluelessness of life."},"id":"f11abd50-b57a-599a-bc59-a550408e5202","excerpt":"Ladies and gentlemen, teachers, administrators, Class of 2019:  \\nGood evening.
