Seeing that it was near the end of a decade, I wanted to document the music that I found impactful and defined the past 10 years. Using the Jonathan Edwards printing press and Yale Printing & Publishing Services, I produced 10 disc-shaped leaflets bound in a jewel case, each telling the story of one album.\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n        <b>Problem</b> But, afterall, it was printed in an edition of five, with one sent to the Special Collections at Yale. How would I bring permanence and lasting impact to the project?\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n        <b>Solution</b> Build a React app to showcase the 10 albums and let the book live on the internet, forever.\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/projectimages/albumheadercolor.png\" alt=\"10 Header\"></p>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"original-design\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Original Design\n</span>\n    The front and back covers with tracklist, as well as the side piece are meant to give the illusion of an actual album packaging. Inside the jewel case, the circular printed cards extend the contrast between paper and compact discs as different means of distributing media, drawing from the technological advancements of recent decades as well as comparing the relative transience of printed ephemera versus the durability of plastic CDs.\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/projectimages/albumdesign.jpg\" alt=\"10 Slider\">\n<img src=\"/projectimages/albumdesignslider.png\" alt=\"10 Slider\"></p>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"web-design\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Web Design\n</span>\n    The web implementation takes into consideration adding additional information to the physical version, while maintaining consistency of aesthetics. As such, the serif type is kept constant with Garamond and Moret. Overall, each full-height page is meant to feel like one page in a book, whereas clicking on either the left or right side of the page simulates the flipping of book pages.\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/projectimages/albumweb1.png\" alt=\"10 Figma1\">\n<img src=\"/projectimages/albumweb2.png\" alt=\"10 Figma2\"></p>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"process\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Process\n</span>\n    <ul style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">\n        <li> <i>To reduce the project’s bulk</i>, built components with React hooks that make calls to the Last.fm API to retrieve album information, such as artist, year, title, and cover art of album.\n        <li> <i>To create background gradient</i>, used React Palette to extract the dominant colors from the album art. \n        <li> <i>To build a responsive experience</i>, set font size with vw, cursor highlight with CSS hover rule, and header and footer as fixed on mobile devices.\n    </ul>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/projectimages/albumfigma1.jpg\" alt=\"10 Result1\">\n<img src=\"/projectimages/albumfigma2.jpg\" alt=\"10 Result2\"></p>\n<div class=\"csblock\" id=\"results\"> \n<span class=\"csblockheading\">\n    Results\n</span>\n    <ul style=\"margin-top: 5px;\">\n        <li> <b>Evolution of media:</b> from paper to compact disc to the world wide web, each step in the project represents a stage in technological progress and the means of information consumption.
